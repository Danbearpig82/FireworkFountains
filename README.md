# FireworkFountains
Makes firework fountains out of candles in Minecraft

This datapack adds firework fountains that can be purchased from Victor the Fireworks Salesman. To summon Victor, use the function "/function fireworks:summon_fireworks_salesman".

Fireworks come in packages of four, and each package costs four emeralds. Victor has 20 of each package in stock, and there is one for each color of candle. All are very similar and themed to their color, but some have extra special effects. The basic candle is a patriotic American Independence Day themed candle. They don't have very creative names yet, suggestions are appreciated! They do use a lot of particle effects, so if you want to set off a lot of fireworks at once be aware that your frame rate will be affected... players with lower end PCs may want to set particles to minimal. For best results, 1-4 fountains at a time makes for a good show.

To use a firework, simply place it as you would any block*. Remember that fireworks are dangerous, and should not be lit near people or flammable structures! Light the fuse and get away. Do not approach or pick up the firework until it has burned completely and is fully extinguished! Keep spash water bottles handy for emergency situations, these will extinguish the fireworks safely.

\*If picked up after being placed, the firework will be an ordinary candle.

=====================================================================

Planned additions:

Different options for the patriotic candle for multiple countries (I chose USA because that is my country and I'm making this for my Independence Day).
Breaking a firework before lighting it should drop a firework fountain rather than an ordinary candle.
